Uninitentional non-adherence has consequences for the health of patients and
it's a great concern for healthcare providers in terms of patient outcomes and
costly health complications. With the Medication Manager App, the goal is to
reduce unintentional non-adherence and to create a convenient and easy-to-use
appliaction that tracks the users medication intake. The system is based on a
relational database with its medication management and data logging functions.
We hope to provide a comfortable user experience.
